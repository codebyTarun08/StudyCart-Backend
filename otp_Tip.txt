const otp = otpGenerator.generate(6, {
  digits: true,
  alphabets: false,
  upperCase: false,
  specialChars: false
});

✅ Features:
Custom length

Choose digits/letters/specials

Lightweight

Great for SMS/email-based OTP

2. crypto (built-in Node.js module) 🔐 Secure Option
If you want to avoid third-party packages and go super secure:

js
Copy
Edit
const crypto = require('crypto');

const otp = crypto.randomInt(100000, 999999).toString();
console.log(otp); // e.g. "672193"
✅ Pros:
No need to install anything

Very secure (true random)

❗ Limitation:
Only numeric, limited control unless you custom-code

✅ Corporate Recommendation
Use otp-generator if you need flexibility and want to customize OTP format.

Use crypto if you're focused on pure numeric OTPs and need high entropy (security), especially for financial/critical apps.

💡 Tip: Always store OTPs in DB with an expiry time and hash them using bcrypt or crypto.createHash() for security.
